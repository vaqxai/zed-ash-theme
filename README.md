# A dark, red and orange theme for the Zed Editor.
Molten is a symphonic eruption of heat and code. Born from the primordial fires of creation, 
this theme channels the raw, untamed energy of volcanic forges where silicon and carbon dance in perfect harmony. 
It's the aesthetic offspring of molten lava flows and the amber glow of electron tubes in vintage mainframes.

This is not merely a color scheme—it's a visual manifestation of computational thermodynamics. 
Molten transforms your editor into a blast furnace of productivity. Each character glows with the intensity of a 
trillion transistors switching at light speed, creating a mesmerizing cascade of golden amber against the obsidian darkness.

Molten doesn't just illuminate your code—it incinerates inefficiency and forges clarity from chaos. 
This theme is for developers who don't just write code; they smelt it from raw logic and hammer it into digital steel. 
It raises the ambient temperature of your development environment by several hundred degrees.
